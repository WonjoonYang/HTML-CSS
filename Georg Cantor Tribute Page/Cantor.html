			<h2>Here's a short biography of Georg Cantor:</h2>
			<p>The German Georg Cantor was an outstanding violinist, but an even more outstanding mathematician. He was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he lived until he was eleven. Thereafter, the family moved to Germany, and Cantor received his remaining education at Darmstradt, Zürich, Berlin and (almost inevitably) Göttingen before marrying and settling at the University of Halle, where he was to spend the rest of his career.<br>He was made full professor at Halle at the age of just 34, a notable accomplishment, but his ambitions to move to a more prestigious university, such as Berlin, were largely thwarted by Leopold Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor’s former professor, who fundamentally disagreed with the thrust of Cantor’s work.
